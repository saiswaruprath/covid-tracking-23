# covid-tracking-23
A COVID19 tracking app. 
The goal is to create a cross-platform mobile solution that can have universal access for everyone using the app for better understanding of covid cases.

## Engineering
The idea is to develop 5 separate tabs which will be there at the bottom of the app:

World — to show the COVID19 Dashboard
Country — Select country to check the cases
News — to get the latest news regarding Corona Pandemic
Guidelines — to read and watch all advisory and guidelines
Help — for help and feedback.
